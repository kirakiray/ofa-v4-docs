# ofa-v4-docs

This is just a website generation tool

## Directory structure

The main files are located in the packages directory, here is the directory description: 

- **docs** : Directory for ofa.js documentation. 
- **generator** : Library for converting .md files to HTML. 
- **translator** : Library to translate .md files from one language to another. 
- **statics** : Static files for running the project.

<!-- ## Workflow 

1. write the documentation for ofa.js v4 in the **docs** directory; the **cn** documentation is the main one to edit. 2. use the **translator** library to translate .md files into HTML. 
2. use **translator** to translate the cn documents in the **docs** directory into other languages and put them into the same directory. 3. use **generator** to translate the cn documents into other languages and put them into the same directory. 
3. use **generator** to convert the .md documents in the **docs** directory to static pages, and place the generated pages in the **dist** directory of the root directory for display and access. -->
