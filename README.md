# ofa-v4-docs

Welcome to the ofa.js v4 documentation repository!

## Directory structure

The main files are located in the packages directory, which is described below: 

- **docs** : The directory where the ofa.js documentation is stored. 
- **example** : The directory where the examples are stored;
- **generator** : Library for converting .md files to HTML. 
- **translator** : A library for translating .md files from one language to another. 
- **website** : Contains a static HTML document generated by the generator to show the final result.


## Workflow 

1. write the documentation for ofa.js v4 in the **docs** directory; the **cn** documentation is the main one to edit. 2. utilize **translator** to create the documentation for ofa.js. 
2. use **translator** to translate the cn documents in the **docs** directory into other languages and put them in the same directory. 3. use **generator** to translate the cn documents into other languages and put them in the same directory. 
3. use **generator** to convert the .md documents in the **docs** directory to static pages and place the generated pages in the **website** directory for display and access.

We look forward to seeing you gain a deeper understanding of ofa.js v4 through this documentation site. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us!
