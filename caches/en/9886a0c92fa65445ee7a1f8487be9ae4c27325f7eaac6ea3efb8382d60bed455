In this example, we created a form that includes text input boxes, radio buttons, and a text area. We used the `formData` method to create an object called `data`, which contains the values of these form elements. We also used the `watch` method to monitor changes in the data and display the data on the page in real-time. When users modify the values of the form elements, the `data` object will be updated accordingly, making data processing simple and efficient.
