1. Independent Deployment: Each component and page can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, enabling teams to release new features and resolve issues more quickly.

2. Integration: Applications developed based on ofa.js can combine different modules together. This can be achieved through sharing compositions via applications, pages, components, etc.

3. Independent Teams: Each frontend module (component/page/application) can be developed and maintained by an independent team, encouraging autonomy and innovation within teams.

4. Shared Resources: In the ofa.js project, there are usually shared resources such as styles, components, and pages to ensure consistency and efficiency.

5. On-demand Loading: Applications in ofa.js can load modules as needed, enhancing application performance and loading speed.
