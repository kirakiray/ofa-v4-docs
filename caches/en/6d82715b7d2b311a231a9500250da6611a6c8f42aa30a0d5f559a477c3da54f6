In this example, we first create a `$` instance object called `target`, and then register two listeners using the `watch` method and `watchTick` method respectively. Afterwards, we use the `unwatch` method to revoke these two listeners by passing in the saved return values `tid1` and `tid2`. This means that the property changes in the first `setTimeout` will not trigger any listeners because they have been revoked.
