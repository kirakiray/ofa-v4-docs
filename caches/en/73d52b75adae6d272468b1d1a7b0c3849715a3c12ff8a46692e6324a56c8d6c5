In the above example, we use custom form components by adding the `<custom-input>` element and setting the `name` attribute. Then, we use the `formData()` method to listen to the values of input elements and custom components, in order to retrieve and process the form data in real-time. This approach allows you to easily extend your form to include custom form components, meeting your specific needs.
