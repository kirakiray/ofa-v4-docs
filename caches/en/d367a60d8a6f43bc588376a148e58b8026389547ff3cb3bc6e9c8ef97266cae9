ofa.js is an emerging framework, and the author's limited spare time means that the SSR solution has not been fully developed yet. However, if ofa.js gains more users in the future and there is a strong demand for an SSR solution, the author will continue to improve and develop this solution. Currently, the author is focusing on the stability and feature expansion of the framework, and welcomes user feedback and suggestions to better meet user needs in the future.
