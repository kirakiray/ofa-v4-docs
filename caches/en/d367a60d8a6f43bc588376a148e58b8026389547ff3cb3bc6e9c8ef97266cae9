ofa.js is an emerging framework, and the author's spare time is limited, so the SSR scheme has not been fully developed yet. However, if ofa.js can have more users in the future and there is a strong demand for the SSR scheme, the author will continue to improve and develop this scheme. Currently, the author will focus on the stability and functionality expansion of the framework, and also welcomes feedback and suggestions from users in order to better meet their needs in the future.
