- The `x-if` tag accepts a `value` attribute to define a condition. If the value of `value` is `true`, the content inside `x-if` will be rendered. In this example, if `count` is an even number, red text will be displayed.
- The `x-else-if` tag also accepts a `value` attribute to define a condition. If the previous conditions are not met and the value of `value` is `true`, the content inside `x-else-if` will be rendered. In this example, if `count` is a multiple of 3, blue text will be displayed.
- The `x-else` tag does not require a `value` attribute. It will render its content when none of the previous conditions are met. In this example, if `count` is neither an even number nor a multiple of 3, green text will be displayed. The `x-else` tag can also be placed immediately after `x-if`.
