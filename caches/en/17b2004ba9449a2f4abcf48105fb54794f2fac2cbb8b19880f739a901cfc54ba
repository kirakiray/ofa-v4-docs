The template of the parent page container needs to set a `<slot>` element so that the child pages can be inserted into the specified position of the parent page. At the same time, make sure that the container element of the `<slot>` element is set to `position: relative`. This is very important because the child pages will be absolutely positioned within the parent page container.
