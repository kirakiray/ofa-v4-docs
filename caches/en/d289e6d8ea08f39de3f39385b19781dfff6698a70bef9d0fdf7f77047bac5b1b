Page modules are similar to component modules, but with a few differences. Page modules use the `page` attribute to define templates instead of the `component` attribute. The development logic for page modules is the same as for component modules, using the same template syntax, template components, and so on. However, page modules cannot use the `attrs` feature because page parameters are usually passed via URL, not via `data` or `attrs`.
