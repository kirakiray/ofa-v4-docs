In this example, we first create a `$` instance object called `target`, and then use the `watch` method to listen for changes in it. Even if we modify the value of a sub-object of the object, such as `target.bbb.child.val`, these changes can be detected and the content of the `logger` element will be updated in the `watch` method. This demonstrates the powerful features of the `$` instance object, allowing you to easily monitor changes in objects.
