Sometimes, when we try to render a list into a select or table, the browser may automatically remove the `<x-fill>` element, which prevents the list from being rendered correctly. In this case, you can use the "replace-temp" method for rendering. The way to use "replace-temp" is to set `is="replace-temp"` in a `<template>` tag and place this template inside an element that the browser will automatically fix.
