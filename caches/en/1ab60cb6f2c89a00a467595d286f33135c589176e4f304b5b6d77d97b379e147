After successfully introducing ofa.js, the `load-module` component will be automatically registered. This is a component used to declaratively import modules, similar to a script tag. This component acts as a proxy to load the specified `src` module and preprocess the modules that need to be loaded. In this example, it will load the template and register the simple-button component.
