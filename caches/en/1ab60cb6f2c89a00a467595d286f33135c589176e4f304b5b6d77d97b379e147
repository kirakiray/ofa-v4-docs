After successfully introducing ofa.js, the `load-module` component will be automatically registered. This is a component used to declaratively reference modules, similar to the script tag. This component will proxy load the specified `src` modules and preprocess the modules that need to be loaded. In this case, templates will be loaded and the simple-button component will be registered.
