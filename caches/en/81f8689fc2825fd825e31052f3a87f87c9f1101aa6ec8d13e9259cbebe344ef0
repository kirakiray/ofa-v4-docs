- The `load` method is an asynchronous loading function, used in the same way as asynchronous `import` loading. You can use `const data = await load(xxx)` to load asynchronous modules.
- Modules loaded through `load` have the same effect as modules loaded through `load-module`. The `load` method is a function version of the `load-module` component. For specific usage, you can refer to the documentation of [https://github.com/kirakiray/drill.js](https://github.com/kirakiray/drill.js).
- `url` is the file name of the current module.
- `query` is an object converted from the URL parameters when loading this module.
