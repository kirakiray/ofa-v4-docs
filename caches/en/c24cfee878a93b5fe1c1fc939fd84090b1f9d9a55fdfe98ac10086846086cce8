In this example, we create a custom component `composed-test` that includes an element in the shadow DOM and a button that triggers an event. By default, the event does not penetrate the shadow DOM to the root node. However, by using the `composed: true` parameter when triggering the event, we allow the event to penetrate to the root node, triggering elements outside of the root node.
