We plan to provide a complete SSR (Server-Side Rendering) scheme in the future. The principle of this scheme is to first fetch the element content of the next page, and then compare it with the current page's tag content to dynamically add, delete, and modify attribute values. However, it is important to note that this SSR scheme will be more time-consuming because it involves complex element comparison and modification operations.
