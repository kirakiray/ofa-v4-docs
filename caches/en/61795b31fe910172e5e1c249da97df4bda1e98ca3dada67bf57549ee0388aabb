We plan to provide a complete Server-Side Rendering (SSR) solution in the future. The principle of this solution is to first obtain the element content of the next page, and then compare it with the current page's tag content in order to dynamically add, delete, and modify attribute values. However, it is important to note that this SSR solution can be time-consuming because it involves complex element comparison and modification operations.
