```javascript
// simple-button.mjs
export const type = $.COMP;

// The component name that needs to be registered. When the tag attribute is not defined, the registered component name is the same as the file name
// export const tag = 'simple-button';

// The address of the component template. When not defined, the component with the same name as the current module is loaded by default in the same directory
// export const temp = './simple-button.html';
