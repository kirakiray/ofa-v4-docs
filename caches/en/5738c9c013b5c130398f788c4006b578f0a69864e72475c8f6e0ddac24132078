In the above example, when you click the submit button "Submit", it will display "Hello, {name}! Form submission prevented.", but it will not trigger the alert "Form Submitted!". This is because we call `event.preventDefault()` in the click event handler of the submit button to prevent the default submission behavior of the form.
