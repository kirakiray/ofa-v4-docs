In this example, we first create a `$` instance object called `target`. Then, we use the `watch` method and the `watchTick` method to listen for changes in the object. The `watch` method runs immediately when the data changes, while the `watchTick` method only executes once in a single thread, limiting the frequency of listening operations. You can choose to use either the `watch` or `watchTick` method depending on your needs to monitor data changes.
