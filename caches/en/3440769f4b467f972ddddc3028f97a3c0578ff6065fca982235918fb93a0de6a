The current SCSR solution is actually more similar to a SSG (Static Site Generation) solution because it pre-renders the pages into static content and then interacts with them through the client. ofa.js has provided a relatively independent component encapsulation solution, allowing frontend developers to encapsulate components and combine them with traditional backend rendering solutions (such as website rendering frameworks in languages like Node.js, Go, Java, PHP, etc.), enabling backend developers to quickly use these encapsulated components to build high-quality web pages.
