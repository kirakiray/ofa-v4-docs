**ofa.js** naturally possesses the characteristics of micro frontends. What sets it apart from other frameworks is that components, pages, and applications developed based on **ofa.js** do not require pre-compilation. In comparison to frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, which need to be built in a Node.js environment to generate client-side code, **ofa.js** development code can be directly placed on a static server, without the need for additional build steps, allowing real-time viewing, usage, and execution.
