**ofa.js** has inherent micro front-end features. The key difference between it and other frameworks is that components, pages, and applications developed with **ofa.js** do not require pre-compilation. In comparison to frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, which require a build step in a Node.js environment to generate client-side code, **ofa.js** allows development code to be directly hosted on a static server without additional build steps. This enables real-time viewing, usage, and execution.
