In this example, we first created a form that includes a text input box, radio buttons, and a text area. Then we used the `formData` method to generate a data object called `data`. Afterwards, by modifying the properties of the `data` object, we achieved two-way data binding, which means the values of the form elements will automatically update as the object properties change. This two-way data binding feature makes interacting with form data more convenient.
