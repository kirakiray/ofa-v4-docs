Below is an example of SCSR, which shows how to render the content of a page module directly on the page:

```html
<scsr:module name="example-module">
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
</scsr:module>
```

Based on the example above, the content within the `<scsr:module>` tag will be rendered directly on the page when the module named "example-module" is loaded.

To use this feature, you need to have the appropriate module defined and registered in your SCSR framework. By using the module name as the value of the `name` attribute, you can easily embed the content within the module on any page.
