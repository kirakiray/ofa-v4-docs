Before starting to create components, there are some preparations that need to be done. Since creating components involves browser resource requests, if you only double-click to open an HTML file for viewing, it will be viewed under the "file" protocol. Under the "file" protocol, the loading of JavaScript modules may result in errors. Therefore, you need to prepare a static server to correctly view the components.
