Before creating a component, there are some preparations to be made. Since creating a component involves browser requests for resources, if you simply double-click to open the HTML file for viewing, it will be viewed under the "file" protocol. Under the "file" protocol, loading JavaScript modules may result in errors. Therefore, you need to prepare a static server to view the components correctly.
