The instance objects obtained or created through `$` have complete [stanz](https://github.com/kirakiray/stanz) data features because the `$` instance inherits from [stanz](https://github.com/kirakiray/stanz). This means that you can use the data manipulation methods and features provided by `stanz` to manipulate and listen to the data of the instance objects.
