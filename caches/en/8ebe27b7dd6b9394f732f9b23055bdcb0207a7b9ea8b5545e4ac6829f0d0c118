In ofa.js, each component has a Shadow DOM container to isolate the internal content of the component. The template content is rendered into this container. The component instance obtained through `$` can also access the Shadow DOM container within the component by using the `shadow` property, thereby achieving manipulation and access to the internal elements of the component.
