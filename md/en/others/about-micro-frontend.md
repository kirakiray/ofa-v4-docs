# About Micro Frontends

Micro Frontends is a front-end architecture pattern designed to help teams better build and maintain large, complex front-end applications. It draws on the ideas of microservices architecture, dividing front-end applications into smaller independent parts, each of which can be developed, tested, and deployed by different teams.

In the process of expanding traditional monolithic front-end applications, it may become difficult to maintain and expand. The goal of micro frontends is to split the application into smaller and more manageable modules, enabling development teams to independently develop and deploy these modules, thereby improving team efficiency and application maintainability.

**ofa.js** naturally possesses the characteristics of micro frontends. What sets it apart from other frameworks is that components, pages, and applications developed based on **ofa.js** do not require pre-compilation. In comparison to frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, which need to be built in a Node.js environment to generate client-side code, **ofa.js** development code can be directly placed on a static server, without the need for additional build steps, allowing real-time viewing, usage, and execution.

**ofa.js** conforms to the characteristics of micro frontends:

1. **Independent Deployment**: Each component and page can be independently developed, tested, and deployed, enabling teams to release new features and address issues more rapidly.

2. **Integration**: Applications developed based on **ofa.js** can combine different modules. This can be achieved through sharing combinations of applications, pages, and components, among other methods.

3. **Independent Teams**: Each front-end module (component/page/application) can be developed and maintained by independent teams, thereby encouraging team autonomy and innovation.

4. **Shared Resources**: In **ofa.js** projects, there are usually shared resources such as styles, components, and pages, to ensure consistency and efficiency.

5. **On-demand Loading**: **ofa.js** applications can load modules as needed, thereby improving application performance and loading speed.

Although **ofa.js** cannot directly use components developed with frameworks like Vue and React, components developed based on **ofa.js** can be used by Vue and React, providing greater flexibility and extensibility for developers using different technology stacks.
