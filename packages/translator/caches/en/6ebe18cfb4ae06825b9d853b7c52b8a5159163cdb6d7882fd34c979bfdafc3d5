In the example above, `:text="greeting"` binds the value of the `greeting` property in the component's `data` to the text content of the `<p>` element. `:value="inputValue"` binds the value of the `inputValue` property in the component's `data` to the `value` attribute of the `<input>` element. For custom components, `custom-prop` is the name of the property in the custom component that receives the value of the `customValue` property in the component's `data`.
