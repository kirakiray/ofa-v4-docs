2. Create an ES module to set the configuration data for the application. The configuration data includes the following options:

- `home`: A string specifying the page module address for the application's homepage.
- `loading`: A function that runs when the application is loading a new page. The content returned by this function will be inserted into the application as a loading indicator, and it will automatically be removed when the page finishes loading.
- `fail`: A function that runs when the application fails to load a page. The value returned by this function will be displayed in the application as a loading failure message. The function receives the source address of the failed page and the error object.
- `pageAnime`: The animation configuration for page transitions.
