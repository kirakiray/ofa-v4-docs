The current SCSR scheme is actually more similar to a SSG (Static Site Generation) scheme, as it pre-renders the pages into static content and then interacts with them through the client side. ofa.js already provides a relatively independent component encapsulation scheme, allowing frontend developers to encapsulate components and then combine them with traditional backend rendering page schemes (such as Node.js, Go, Java, PHP, etc.) to quickly create high-quality web pages.
