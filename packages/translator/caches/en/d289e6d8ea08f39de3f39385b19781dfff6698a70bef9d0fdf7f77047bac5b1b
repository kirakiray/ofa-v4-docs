Page modules are similar to component modules but with some differences. Page modules use the `page` attribute to define the template instead of the `component` attribute. The development logic and template syntax for page modules are the same as component modules. However, page modules cannot use the `attrs` attribute because page parameters are typically passed through the URL, not through `data` or `attrs`.
