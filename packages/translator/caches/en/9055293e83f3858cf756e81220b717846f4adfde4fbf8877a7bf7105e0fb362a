- **created()**: Called when the component is created, before the shadow root has started rendering. You can perform some initialization settings here, but you cannot access elements within the shadow root.
  
- **ready()**: Called after the shadow root has finished rendering. It is generally used for component initialization logic. At this stage, you can access and manipulate elements within the shadow root, as well as perform other operations that need to be done after rendering is complete.

- **watch**: Observes changes in data by defining the `watch` object. After `ready` completes, a watch corresponding to the value in `data` will be triggered. Subsequently, each time the value of the corresponding key changes, the corresponding function within `watch` will be triggered.

- **attached()**: Called when the component is added to the document. You can perform operations that interact with the external environment, such as obtaining the appearance of the component or initializing shared data.

- **detached()**: Called when the component is removed from the document. At this stage, you can perform cleanup, cancel interaction with the external environment, and release resources.
