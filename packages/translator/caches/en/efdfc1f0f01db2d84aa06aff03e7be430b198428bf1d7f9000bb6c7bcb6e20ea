- The `<x-if>` tag accepts a `value` attribute to define the condition. If the value of `value` is `true`, the content inside `<x-if>` will be rendered. In this example, if `count` is an even number, red text will be displayed.
- The `<x-else-if>` tag also accepts a `value` attribute to define the condition. If the previous condition is not met and the value of `value` is `true`, the content inside `<x-else-if>` will be rendered. In this example, if `count` is a multiple of 3, blue text will be displayed.
- The `<x-else>` tag does not require a `value` attribute. It will render its content when none of the previous conditions are met. In this example, if `count` is neither an even number nor a multiple of 3, green text will be displayed. `<x-else>` can also immediately follow `<x-if>`;
