          <p>
            Markdown's syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a
            format for <em>writing</em> for the web.
          </p>

          <p>
            Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its
            syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of
            HTML tags. The idea is <em>not</em> to create a syntax that makes it
            easier to insert HTML tags. In my opinion, HTML tags are already
            easy to insert. The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read,
            write, and edit prose. HTML is a <em>publishing</em> format;
            Markdown is a <em>writing</em> format. Thus, Markdown's formatting
            syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain text.
          </p>

          <p>
            For any markup that is not covered by Markdown's syntax, you simply
            use HTML itself. There's no need to preface it or delimit it to
            indicate that you're switching from Markdown to HTML; you just use
            the tags.
          </p>

          <p>
            The only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements -- e.g.
            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, etc. -- must be
            separated from surrounding content by blank lines, and the start and
            end tags of the block should not be indented with tabs or spaces.
            Markdown is smart enough not to add extra (unwanted)
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags around HTML block-level tags.
          </p>
