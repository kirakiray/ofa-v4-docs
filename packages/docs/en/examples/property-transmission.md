# Property Transmission

With the **property transmission** template syntax, you can apply the component's data to element attributes within the template.

The method is to add the attribute `:name="key"` to the element, where `name` is the name of the target element attribute to be set, and `key` is the property key you want to pass from your custom component.

Previously, when mentioning the <a href='./index.html' olink>way to set attributes using selectors</a>, the attribute transmission syntax for setting attributes is introduced here.
