# routerChange event

`routerChange` event is an event specific to the `o-page` element, and it is only triggered on the nested parent page of `o-page`. This event is triggered when the application's router changes, whether it is navigating to a new page or returning to a previous page.

It provides a way to listen and respond to changes in the application's routing, typically used in the parent page of nested pages. When the route changes, you can listen for the `routerChange` event to perform corresponding actions, such as updating page content or navigation status.

This event is very useful for building applications with multiple nested pages, making navigation and communication between pages easier.
