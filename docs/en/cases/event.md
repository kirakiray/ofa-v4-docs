# Event Response

You can use the `on` method to bind events. **Events** are the most basic concept in development, and applications rely on event triggers to generate feedback and achieve interactivity.

The following example demonstrates how to bind a click event:

In this example, we selected the `button` element using `$` and bound the `click` event using the `on` method. When the button is clicked, the callback function is triggered, changing the text content of the `target` element to "Hello, world!".

If you want to learn more about available event types, please refer to the [Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) documentation.
