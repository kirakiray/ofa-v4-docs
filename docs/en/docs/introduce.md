# ofa.js - Progressive Front-end Framework

## What is ofa.js

ofa.js is a progressive front-end framework designed to allow developers to enter the front-end development and usage process at the lowest cost. It provides a series of simple yet powerful tools and APIs to make front-end development more efficient and convenient.

## Purpose of Existence

### Replace jQuery

In many small projects, we may not need to introduce large frameworks like React and Vue, but prefer to use jQuery for simple front-end operations. ofa.js improves the API of jQuery and replaces many of jQuery's methods with properties, making ofa.js more suitable in many scenarios.

### Simplify front-end development and usage process

ofa.js aims to simplify the cumbersome front-end development process. It allows developers to build front-end applications more quickly without the need to learn complex tools such as Node.js, npm, and scaffolding. With it, you can go back to the experience of just importing one library to develop.
